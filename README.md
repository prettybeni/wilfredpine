I teach IT students at Mindoro State University about programming, databases, embedded systems, and multimedia as a college instructor. I enjoy sharing small knowledge and ideas to people for their future careers. I gain my expertise through my experience and from other professionals who well-instruct and mentor me, thus I want to impart it to others as well. I'm interested in learning more about various technologies.
